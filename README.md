# rm_ml_experiments

## Installation

Dependencies:
  - javac 1.7+
  - git
  - python2.7

Run `make install`; you may need to call this with sudo depending on
your operating system

## Makefile commands

- `generate`: Generates voxel files; output path will be `data/{dataset_name}`
- `train-all`: Train on all models matching current src/config.py and
  produce visualisations
- `install` : Installs dependencies (including camino); see [Installation](#Installation)
- `clean_data` : Deletes all model data generated by the program
- `clean` : Deletes all files installed by the program

## Configuration

Configurations for voxel generation are defined in the
[config.py](./src/config.py) file.
Each configuration is a list of strings in the models list, i.e:

```
models = [
  ["compartment1", "compartment2", "compartment3"],
]
```

The number of voxels to generate can also be set

```
dataset_size = 12500
```

The values supplied for a parameter can either be a numerical value, or a list
of two values. If two values are given, a sample will be taken
in the range provided using uniform sampling.

## Notes on running
If running on a mac, it is suggested to use `caffeinate`, i.e:

`caffeinate python main.py generate && caffeinate python main.py train-all`

This way the mac will not sleep until the generation and training is
completed.
