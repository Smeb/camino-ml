# rm_ml_experiments

## Installation

Dependencies:
  - javac 1.7+
  - git
  - python3 (as python3 on path)

Run `make install`; you may need to call this with sudo.

## Makefile commands

- `gen_data`: Generates voxel files; output path will be `data/{dataset_name}/{fname}.BFloat`
- `install` : Installs dependencies (including camino); see [Installation](#Installation)
- `clean_data` : Deletes all data generated by the program
- `clean` : Deletes all files installed by the program, as well as running `make clean_data`

## Configuration

__Note: Parameters for a model must be in the order camino expects them. The Parameter
  names are not used by the script, and are for reference only__

Configurations for voxel generation are defined in the [config.json](./config.json) file,
and loaded by logic in the [loader.py](./loader.py) file. Each configuration takes
the following form:

`"{dataset_name}": {
    "fname": "{output file name}",
    "models": {compartment models used by camino},
  }`

The models take the form:

`"{model_name}": {
    "{parameter_name}": {value}
  }`

The values supplied for a parameter can either be a numerical value, or a list
of two values. If two values are given, a sample will be taken
in the range provided.

Parameter names have no internal use in the program (at the moment), but are
useful for understanding the config.json file.
